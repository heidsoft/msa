RFC1 english word:

The software for the ARPA Network exists partly in the IMPs and
partly in the respective(各自的) HOSTs.  BB&N has specified the software of
the IMPs and it is the responsibility of the HOST groups to agree on
HOST software.
During the summer of 1968, representatives(代表) from the initial four
sites met several times to discuss the HOST software and initial
experiments on the network.  There emerged(出现) from these meetings a
working group of three, Steve Carr from Utah(美国犹他州), Jeff Rulifson from SRI,
and Steve Crocker of UCLA(加州洛杉矶分校), who met during the fall(秋天) and winter(冬天).  The
most recent meeting was in the last week of March(三月) in Utah.  Also
present(目前) was Bill Duvall of SRI who has recently started working with
Jeff Rulifson.
Somewhat independently(独立), Gerard(杰拉德) DeLoche of UCLA has been working on
the HOST-IMP interface.
I present here some of the tentative(暂定) agreements reached(达成) and some of
the open questions encountered(遇到).  Very little of what is here is firm(加强)
and reactions(反应) are expected(预计).
